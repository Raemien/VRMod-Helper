# VRMod Helper
This program creates a button within the SteamVR dashboard, which automatically focuses the game and runs a keybind.

For this to work, you must set the following keybind in Garry's Mod:
`bind KP_5 vrmod_start`

Once launched, a new panel should appear in your SteamVR dashboard.

I used ViveIsAwesome's console app template as a base, so here's a link to that repo:
